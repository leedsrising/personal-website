# Getting Started with Create React App

Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - a personal portfolio for my projects and writing.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode (default=brave browser)\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and uses the pre-build script.\
